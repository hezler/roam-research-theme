# Missing some colors?
  <strong> - here is the answer </strong>
  
You have to manually put in the light green on "Kapittel 1" by your self.
 
  1. Simply put this code in: $$\text{\color{#63dd92}Kapittel 1 - Intro til }$$
        The light green comes from the HEX color code #63dd92
        
  2. Simply put this code in: $$\text{\color{#63dd92}Kapittel 1 - Intro til }$$
        The light green comes from the HEX color code #63dd92
