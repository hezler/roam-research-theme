# Missing some colors (from screenshot number 1)?
  <strong> - here is the answer </strong>
  
  You have to manually put in the colors for:
  
   1. Light green on "Kapittel 1" by your self.
       Simply put this code in: $$\text{\color{#63dd92}Kapittel 1 - Intro til }$$
        The light green comes from the HEX color #63dd92
        
   2. Yellow on "Ets historie" by your self.
       Simply put this code in: $$\text{\color{#f7c331}Ets historie}$$
        The yellow comes from the HEX color #f7c331

   2. Soft pink on "To kategorier av Wi-Fi:".
        Simply put this code in: $$\text{\color{#F17272}To kategorier av Wi-Fi:}$$
         The soft pink comes from the HEX color #F17272
